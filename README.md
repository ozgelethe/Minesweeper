 Minesweeper is a 1960s era video game played on an m-by-n grid of cells. 
 
 The goal is to deduce which cells contain hidden mines using clues about the number of mines in neighboring cells.
 
  Minesweeper.java that takes three integer command-line arguments m, n, and k and prints an m-by-n grid of cells with k mines, using asterisks for mines and integers for the neighboring mine counts.
